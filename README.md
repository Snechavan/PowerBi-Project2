# PowerBi-Project2: Elevating My SQL Skills at IIM Kashipur!📊💡

## Overview
This project showcases my journey through an enriching SQL workshop organized by TITAN at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Kashipu. The workshop focused on advanced SQL techniques, including complex joins, subqueries, and aggregate function. The culmination of this learning is a comprehensive dashboard created using Power BI, which integrates data from multiple tables to provide insightful visualization

## Workshop Highlights

- **Instructor:* Arpit Mishra, Senior Software Engineer at Zomato (working on Blinkit), with over 4 years of experience in SQL and database managemen

- **Key Learnings:**
   The importance of SQL in data-driven decision-makin
   In-depth exploration of SQL queries: DDL, DML, and mor
   Mastery of joins, groups, indexes, subqueries, and view
   Practical applications of aggregate functions, sorting, and limiting result

## Project Details
In this project, I applied the SQL skills acquired during the workshop to join multiple tables and create a dynamic dashboard using Power B. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations that provide insights into the combined data, demonstrating the practical application of advanced SQL techniques in data analysis and visualizatio

## Features

- **Data Integration:* Combines data from 4-5 related tables using complex SQL querie
- **Interactive Dashboard:* Developed using Power BI, featuring filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilitie
- **Visualizations:* Includes bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent key metric
- **User-Friendly Interface:* Designed for intuitive navigation and data exploratio

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:* For data extraction and manipulatio
- **Power BI:* For data visualization and dashboard creatio
