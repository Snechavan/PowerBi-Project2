# PowerBi-Project2: Elevating My SQL Skills at IIM Kashipur!📊💡

## Overview
This project showcases my journey through an enriching SQL workshop organized by TITAN at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Kashipu. The workshop focused on advanced SQL techniques, including complex joins, subqueries, and aggregate function. The culmination of this learning is a comprehensive dashboard created using Power BI, which integrates data from multiple tables to provide insightful visualization

## Workshop Highlights

- **Instructor:* Arpit Mishra, Senior Software Engineer at Zomato (working on Blinkit), with over 4 years of experience in SQL and database managemen

- **Key Learnings:**
*The Importance of SQL in Data-Driven Decision-Making 📊💡
*In-Depth Exploration of SQL Queries: DDL, DML, and More 🛠️🔍
*Mastery of Joins, Groups, Indexes, Subqueries, and Views 🔗🔢🔎
*Practical Applications of Aggregate Functions, Sorting, and Limiting Results 📈🔢🔒

## Project Details
In this project, I applied the SQL skills acquired during the workshop to join multiple tables and create a dynamic dashboard using Power B. The dashboard offers interactive visualizations that provide insights into the combined data, demonstrating the practical application of advanced SQL techniques in data analysis and visualizatio

## Features

- **Data Integration:* Combines data from 4-5 related tables using complex SQL querie
- **Interactive Dashboard:* Developed using Power BI, featuring filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilitie
- **Visualizations:* Includes bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to represent key metric
- **User-Friendly Interface:* Designed for intuitive navigation and data exploratio

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:* For data extraction and manipulatio
- **Power BI:* For data visualization and dashboard creatio
